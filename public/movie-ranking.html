<h1>The Best Movies According to Jason</h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all time... er... 2023</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>Barbie was a great movie that represented how our society
    does not treat women fairly or equitibly.   My partner and daughters encouraged me to watch the movie 
    and this really helped me see, with some very over the top examples, but also with very realistic examples as well
    How Women are undervalued.

<h3>Wonka</h3>
<p>Wonka was a surprise to me.  I did not believe that anyone could improve on Rahl Dahl's original masterpiese
    Nor did I think anyone could take the mantle and represent Willi Wanka as well as Gene Wilder.
    This is especially true after seeing the horrific Willi Wanka moving with that other guy.
    I loved the music, the references to the original and how well it shocased the talents of the main actor.

<h3>Indiana Jones</h3>
<p>I have been a fan of "Indy" since I was a small boy and this movie did not disapoint.  (how do you spell dissapoint??) anyway I loved it
